# Getting Started

## Select Dataset and Variables

A xcube viewer may hold several datasets which you can select via the drop-down menu **Dataset**. When a new dataset gets selected, the map extent changes, according to the option selected in the [settings](../user_guide/settings.md/#zoom-on-datasetvariable-selection).

If more than one variable is available within a selected xcube dataset, you may change the variable by using the drop-down menu
**Variable**.

## Integrate (User) Base Maps and Overlays

The Viewer gives the option to display the datasets in front of a base map and to overlay datasets with additional information, such as transportation routes or place names. A large number of base maps and overlay layers are already integrated in the Viewer, with the option to add more as needed. Further instructions can be found [here](../user_guide/settings.md/#base-maps-and-overlays).

## Adjust Layer Visibilities

![Datamanagement - Layer Visibilities](../assets/images/viewer/datamanagement_visibility_added.png){ align=right }

The draggable Layer Visibility Menu can be opened on the left-hand side of the viewer. The menu can be used to control the display and hiding of the following objects:

- selected Variable
- pinned Variable (marked by icon)
- User and Dataset Places
- Base Map and Overlay
- boundary box of the selected Dataset
- RGB of Dataset (selected and pinned)

User Base Maps and User Overlays can also be added here.

## Metadata

![Metadata](../assets/images/viewer/datamanagement_meta.png){ align=left }

The metadata information is accessible through a tab in the sidebar, which can be displayed using a button on the right side of the Viewer [1]. This section displays metadata for the selected dataset, variable, or location. The visibility of this information can be enabled at the top left [2].

The metadata can be displayed in three different formats:

1. **Textual:** a property summary in human readable form
2. **Tabular:** the complete list of attributes in a table
3. **JSON:** all the attributes as machine-readable JSON

The format is selected to the right of the title [3].
