# Adjust Settings

In the settings, you have the option to adjust the default settings according to your needs. This can be the xcube Server, the language or adjustments to the Player, time series or the map. Detailed explanations of specific settings are provided below. Additionally, you can find information about legal agreements, as well as the Viewer and server version, within the settings.

## Map

Adjust the **base map** and **overlays**, choose the **projection** (_Geographic_ or _Mercator_), enable **image smoothing** or decide on the **map extent and focus** when selecting datasets or places.

### Base maps and Overlays

The Viewer allows you to display datasets over a Base Map and overlay them with additional information, such as transportation routes or place names. A large number of base maps and overlay layers are already integrated in the Viewer. Others can be selected by clicking on `Base map` or `Overlay`.

### User Base maps and Overlays

Additional layers (WMS, XYZ) from external services can also be added by clicking on `User base map...` or `User overlays...`. These can also be added via the [Layers Panel](../user_guide/getting_started.md/#adjust-layer-visibilities).
