# Getting Started

## Demo

To test the viewer app, you can use the [xcube viewer demo](https://bc-viewer.brockmann-consult.de). This is our Brockmann Consult Demo xcube viewer. Via the [viewer's settings](user_guide/settings.md) it is possible to change the xcube server url which is used for displaying data. Here is another demo server that you may add for testing:

- Euro Data Cube Server (`https://edc-api.brockmann-consult.de/api`) has integrated amongst others a data cube with global essential climate variables (ECVs) variables from the ESA Earth System Data Lab Project. To access the Euro Data Cube viewer directly please visit [https://edc-viewer.brockmann-consult.de](https://edc-viewer.brockmann-consult.de) .

## Build and Deploy

You can also build and deploy your own viewer instance. In the latter case, visit the [xcube-viewer](https://github.com/xcube-dev/xcube-viewer) repository on GitHub and follow the instructions provides in the related [README](https://github.com/xcube-dev/xcube-viewer/blob/main/README.md) file.
