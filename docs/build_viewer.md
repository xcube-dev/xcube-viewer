# Getting Started

## Demo

To check out the features of the app, you can use the  [xcube Viewer demo](https://bc-viewer.brockmann-consult.de). 
It uses a demo server instance to publish a couple of free data cubes. You 
can change the server URL via the [viewer apps's settings](user_guide/settings.md).

Here is another demo server that you may add for testing:

- Euro Data Cube Server (`https://edc-api.brockmann-consult.de/api`) has 
  integrated amongst others a data cube with global essential climate 
  variables (ECVs) variables from the ESA Earth System Data Lab Project. 
  To access the Euro Data Cube viewer directly please 
  visit [https://edc-viewer.brockmann-consult.de](https://edc-viewer.brockmann-consult.de) .
