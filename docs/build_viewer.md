# Getting Started

## Demo

To test the viewer, you can use the [xcube Viewer demo](https://bc-viewer.brockmann-consult.de). This is our 
Brockmann Consult Demo xcube Viewer. Via the [viewer's settings](user_guide/settings.md) it is 
possible to change the xcube Server url which is used for displaying data. 
Here is another demo server that you may add for testing:

- Euro Data Cube Server (`https://edc-api.brockmann-consult.de/api`) has 
  integrated amongst others a data cube with global essential climate 
  variables (ECVs) variables from the ESA Earth System Data Lab Project. 
  To access the Euro Data Cube viewer directly please 
  visit [https://edc-viewer.brockmann-consult.de](https://edc-viewer.brockmann-consult.de) .

## Build and Deploy

You can also build and deploy your own viewer instance. In the latter case,
